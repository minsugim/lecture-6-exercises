### Exercise 3 ###

# Create a vector of 100 employees ("Employee 1", "Employee 2", ... "Employee 100)
employees <- paste('Employee', 1:100)

# Create a vector of 2014 salaries using the runif function
salaries_2014 <- runif(200, 3000, 40000)

# Create a vector of 2015 salaries that are typically higher than the 2014 salaires, but not always
salaries_2015 <- runif(200, 5000, 60000)


# Create a data.frame 'salaries' by combining the vectors you just made


# In "salaries", change the name of Employee 1 to your name. Did you get an error?



# Create a column 'got_raise' that is TRUE if the person got a raise


# How many employees got a raise?


# What was the average salary increase?


# Write a .csv file of your salaries to your working directory


### Bonus ###

# For people who did not get a raise, how much money did they lose?

# Is that what you expected them to lose?

### Double Bonus ###

# Repeat the above experiment 100 times, tracking the loss each time.
# Does the average loss equal what you expect?
# What about 10,000 times?
